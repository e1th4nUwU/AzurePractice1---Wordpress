#### 7. You will now be prompted to create a new App Service. Once you have selected the correct subscription, you'll need to create a new resource group (you can also use one that you had before). In order to create a new one, just click on *Create new*, give it a name, and click *Ok*.

#### 8. You can also choose the specific region where you want to locate your service in. I am located in Mexico, so I will choose a region inside the US so there isn't a lot of latency.
